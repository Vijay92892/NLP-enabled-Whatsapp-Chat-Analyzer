A powerful Python-based tool for extracting and visualizing meaningful insights from WhatsApp chat logs. This project combines robust data processing with static visualizations and an innovative AI-driven conversational agent for dynamic data exploration.

Features âœ¨
Static Dashboards: Generate pre-defined visualizations, including user activity over time, message distribution, and frequently used terms.

AI-Powered Analysis: Use natural language queries to ask specific questions about the chat data, such as "Who was most active last Tuesday?" or "Compare my message count with Jane's," and get custom plots in response.

Word Clouds: Visualize the most common terms in your chat to quickly identify key topics and trends.

Intuitive Interface: Built with seaborn to create clear, aesthetically pleasing graphs and charts.
